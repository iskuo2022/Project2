        <p>Take a rest here and reconsider your own thoughts. In this world of misinformation, our own mental autonomy is more important than ever. What will you make of what the world tells you? What can you make of it? What can you turn it into? Nonsense? Meaning? Who knows? Take a stab at this advice generator by clicking on the "Shuffle Phrase" button and generating your own advice, and click on the "Change Year" button to change the background image to a different point in time. Use "Save Image" if you believe you'll keep this with you in the future. <a href="https://pixabay.com/music/ambient-deep-ambient-version-60s-9889/">Here is where the ambience lies,</a> and <a href="https://www.placestoread.xyz/">here is the aesthetic inspiration for this piece.</a></p>

        <h2>artist statement</h2>
        <p>Going into this project, I wanted to make something out of all the things people have said to me as words of advice. Along with revisiting nature photos from my younger days, I wanted to focus on creating a piece in which the visitor could attempt to make meaning of or take something away from all the tidbits of information I've obtained over my life. The piece is meant to evoke a sense of tranquility and calm, similar to the phenomenon of internet "rest stops", and focus on making the visitor stop and ponder, even if only just for a short while. I primarily wanted to focus on atmosphere that centered around minimalism and calm, which I believe I've achieved.</p>
